Project Description

We will start this week with a small project about tuples. Your task is to write a program that takes a tuple of numbers, finds the second largest number, and prints out that number.

You can start your program by having this tuple as the first line:

numbers = (10, 5, 8, 20, 15)

ğŸ‘‰ Note the difference between tuples and lists? Tuples are surrounded by round parenthesis, and they are immutable. Otherwise, they behave very similar.
"""

numbers = (10, 5, 8, 20, 15)
sorted_nums = set(numbers)
second_high = list(sorted_nums)[-2]
print(second_high)
